### task

I need to replace the main page of the application with `one-off/NIL-Research.github.io/docs/docs/ideal_page.html`
The page should be dynamic (adapting to mobile phone view).

### analysis

The main page of the NIL-Research.github.io website needed to be replaced with a new design from `ideal_page.html`. The existing site is built with Hugo static site generator using the `theme-research-group` theme. The current homepage is defined in `/content/home/index.md` using Markdown with custom CSS.

The new design needed to:
1. Replace the existing homepage with the content from ideal_page.html
2. Make the design responsive for mobile devices
3. Integrate properly with Hugo's templating system

### fix_plan

1. Created a custom Hugo layout template at `layouts/index.html` to override the default homepage
2. Converted the static HTML from ideal_page.html into a Hugo-compatible template
3. Added responsive design features:
   - Mobile hamburger menu for navigation
   - Responsive font sizes using clamp() CSS function
   - Flexible grid layouts for features section
   - Media queries for mobile, tablet, and desktop breakpoints
4. Enhanced mobile experience with:
   - Touch-friendly navigation
   - Proper viewport meta tag
   - Optimized padding and spacing for smaller screens
   - Animated mobile menu with overlay
