subtitle: "Neurocognitive Image Lab"
remarkText: "At the Neurocognitive Image Lab (NIL), our mission is to bridge neuroscience, 
         psychology, philosophy, and the arts. We aim to explore the neural foundations of image 
         perception, neuroaesthetics, and the temporal and spatial dynamics of cognition.
    
         Our rationale is rooted in an interdisciplinary vision: combining cognitive neuroscience, 
         philosophy, and artistic practice, we study how the brain shapes human experience of images, 
         beauty, and time.
    
         NIL is founded with the belief that science and humanities must converge to fully capture 
         the richness of human cognition. We invite scholars, artists, and students alike to 
         contribute to this journey."
