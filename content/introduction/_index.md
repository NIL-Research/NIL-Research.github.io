            The Neurocognitive Image Lab (NIL) is dedicated to exploring the neural foundations of image perception, 
            neuroaesthetics, and the temporal and spatial dynamics of cognition. NIL was founded with the vision of bridging neuroscience 
            and the humanities, fostering an interdisciplinary platform where philosophy, psychology, and brain research converge.
            Our aim is not only to advance scientific understanding, but also to inspire cultural dialogue about how the brain shapes 
            our perception of art, beauty, and time.
