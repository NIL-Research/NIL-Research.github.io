          SISU plans to inaugurate the Neurocognitive Image Lab (NIL) at the 23rd Conference on International Exchange of Professionals, 2025. Support and assistance come from European Academy of Sciences and Arts (EASA), Federation of German Scientists (VDW), “Beyond Boundaries" thinking lab “Para Limes” of the European Science Foundation, and the Institute of Medical Psychology at Ludwig-Maximilian University Munich, Germany. 

          NIL aims to build up an international and interdisciplinary research hub at the forefront of brain science, neuroaesthetics, and image science.  It will explore how the brain encodes visual images, temporal and spatial information, and experiences aesthetic beauty, advancing innovative theories and applications in neuroscience, art and intelligent interaction.  

          The characteristics of research in NIL, the “unique selling point” (USP), is the complementarity of “vertical” and “horizontal” interdisciplinarity. 

          Horizontal Interdisciplinarity fosters connections across diverse fields to discover novel, "unasked questions"—the hallmark of creative research. Bridges in horizontal interdisciplinarity are built to linguistics with the focus on different language competences, to the humanities in general including philosophy, to artificial intelligence and robotics, to technological applications harvesting “unused answers”, to different medical fields like neurology or psychiatry, to art history identifying the cultural differences, to the arts as represented in poetry, music, architecture or visual art. 

          Vertical Interdisciplinarity drives down to the neural mechanisms that underlie subjective phenomena and behavior. Using advanced imaging technologies (MEG, fMRI, EEG) and sophisticated analytical tools, NIL aims to investigate processes like temporal processing and spatial cognition. Crucially, thus research will be conceptually framed within an aesthetic context, making neuroaesthetics a central pillar of NIL's identity.

          By uniting this vertical dive into neural mechanisms with a horizontal expansion across the vast landscape of human knowledge, NIL is poised to open a new chapter in interdisciplinary science. This powerful synergy will not only illuminate the profound connections between brain, image, and aesthetics but also catalyze a future of both fundamental discoveries and practical applications that redefine our understanding of the human experience. 

          **Address**: No. 27 Villa, Wenxiang Road 1550, Songjiang District, Shanghai, China.
