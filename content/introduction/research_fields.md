        Our lab investigates the neural and computational mechanisms underlying human perception and cognition, with a focus on **image perception**, **neuroaesthetics**, and **temporal-spatial processing**. We integrate behavioral experiments, neuroimaging (fMRI/EEG), and computational modeling to bridge mind, brain, and artificial systems.


        ### 🖼️ Image Perception  
        We move beyond artificial stimuli to study real-world vision. Projects include:  
        - Neural encoding of natural scenes  
        - Top-down modulation by attention and expectation  
        - Comparing human vision with CNNs and transformers  

        ### 🎨 Neuroaesthetics  
        Aesthetics as a window into value-based decision-making:  
        - Cross-cultural studies of visual preference  
        - fMRI of art museum visitors  
        - Linking aesthetic experience to default mode network  

        ### ⏳ Spatiotemporal Processing  
        The brain as a predictive engine:  
        - Temporal receptive fields in visual cortex  
        - Integration of audiovisual events  
        - Disruptions in schizophrenia and autism  

        ### 🔗 Interdisciplinary Impact  
        - **AI**: Bio-inspired computer vision  
        - **Clinical**: Biomarkers for perceptual disorders  
        - **Design**: Evidence-based guidelines for visual communication
