      title: "Our Global Network"
      text: |
        The **Neurocognitive Image Lab (NIL)** believes that groundbreaking science emerges at the intersection of disciplines and cultures.  
        We maintain active collaborations with research centers across Europe and Asia, spanning **cognitive neuroscience**, **philosophy of mind**, **metrology**, **artificial intelligence**, and **science ethics**.  

        These partnerships enable us to:
        - Conduct cross-cultural studies on perception and aesthetics  
        - Develop shared methodologies for neural and behavioral measurement  
        - Organize joint workshops, conferences, and artist-scientist residencies  
        - Advocate for responsible innovation in neurotechnology  

        Below are our core institutional partners.
