  The **Neurocognitive Image Lab (NIL)** believes that groundbreaking science emerges at the intersection of disciplines and cultures.  We maintain active collaborations with research centers across Europe and Asia, spanning **cognitive neuroscience**, **philosophy of mind**, **metrology**, **artificial intelligence**, and **science ethics**.  

  These partnerships enable us to:
  - Conduct cross-cultural studies on perception and aesthetics  
  - Develop shared methodologies for neural and behavioral measurement  
  - Organize joint workshops, conferences, and artist-scientist residencies  
  - Advocate for responsible innovation in neurotechnology
