    The Neurocognitive Image Lab (NIL) believes that groundbreaking science emerges at the intersection of disciplines and cultures.  We maintain active collaborations with research centers across Europe and Asia, spanning **cognitive neuroscience**, **philosophy of mind**, **metrology**, **artificial intelligence**, and **science ethics**.  

    These partnerships enable us to:
    - Conduct cross-cultural studies on perception and aesthetics  
    - Develop shared methodologies for neural and behavioral measurement  
    - Organize joint workshops, conferences, and artist-scientist residencies  
    - Advocate for responsible innovation in neurotechnology
