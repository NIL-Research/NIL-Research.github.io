Evgeny Gutyrchik is a neuroscientist and university lecturer in medical psychology at Ludwig Maximilian University in Munich, Germany. He actively engages in intercultural academic exchange, particularly between Germany, Russia, and China. His research focuses on how the brain processes emotionally and culturally salient imagery in ways that support self-reference, symbolic integration, and meaning-making.
Positioned at the intersection of cognitive, affective, and behavioral neuroscience, his work explores the neural mechanisms of aesthetic experience, self-related processing, and existential salience. Dr. Gutyrchik is also a licensed psychotherapist specializing in Jungian psychoanalysis, which deepens his scientific perspective with clinical insight into symbolic and archetypal dimensions of human experience.
He studied psychology at the State University for the Humanities in Moscow, earned his doctorate from Ruhr University Bochum, and completed his postdoctoral qualification in medical psychology at LMU Munich. Over the past 15 years, he has led and contributed to numerous fMRI studies investigating how internal states - such as mortality awareness - influence brain responses.
