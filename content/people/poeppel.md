Professor Ernst Pöppel is a world-renowned psychologist and neuroscientist. He has been elected as a member of multiple prestigious academies, including the German National Academy of Sciences (since 1993), the European Academy of Sciences and Arts (since 1997), the Academia Europaea (since 2015), and the Russian Academy of Education (since 2016). His research focuses primarily on the field of cognitive neuroscience, spanning psychology, neuropsychology, and sensory physiology, with particular emphasis on visual perception, temporal processing (including circadian rhythms), and neuroaesthetics.

With an interdisciplinary perspective and unique theoretical and methodological approaches, Professor Pöppel’s extensive research achievements fully reflect his research philosophy of “vertical interdisciplinarity”—integrating techniques such as electrophysiology, behavioral studies, and neuroimaging—and “horizontal interdisciplinarity,” bridging psychology with fields like brain injury rehabilitation, anesthesiology, neuroaesthetics, and artificial intelligence.

Owing to his significant contributions and influential work in psychology and neuroscience, Professor Pöppel has gained widespread recognition in the international academic community.
