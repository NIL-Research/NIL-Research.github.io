Upholding the motto of "Integrity, Vision and Academic Excellence", **Shanghai International Studies University (SISU)** is an internationally recognized, prestigious academic institution distinctive for its multidisciplinary and multicultural nature, committed to preparing innovative professionals and future global leaders for a wide range of international expertise to address the critical challenges of our times.

Our **history** began in December 1949 with the establishment of the Shanghai Russian School affiliated to East China People's Revolution University, as one of the earliest institutions where China's higher education in foreign languages took shape. Throughout its history, SISU has attracted and retained China's distinguished linguists, translators and philosophers with commitment to teaching and academic pursuits, who have become part of the University's increased wealth of intellectual resources.

As a globalized and top-notch university in China, SISU has successfully developed a diverse and distinctive mix of **disciplines** crossing humanities, social sciences and natural sciences and in the fields of arts, education, economics, management, law and engineering with language and literature as its pillar.

Currently, we offer courses in **54 languages**, including 39 modern languages (English, Russian, French, German, Spanish, Arabic, Japanese, Greek, Italian, Portuguese, Korean, Persian, Thai, Vietnamese, Indonesian, Swedish, Dutch, Hebrew, Ukrainian, Turkish, Hindi, Hungarian, Uzbek, Kazakh, Polish, Czech, Urdu, Malay, Swahili, Javanese, Pashto, Tajik, Romanian, Belarusian, Sundanese, Cambodian, Bengali and Chinese). We also teach 15 classical and constructed languages: Latin, Ancient Greek, Old English, Sanskrit, Syriac Aramaic, Pahlavi, Classical Nahuatl, Yucatec Maya, Akkadian, Sumerian, Classical Hebrew, Ottoman Turkish, Gandhari, Esperanto and sign language.

With a mission to "introduce the rest of the world to China" and "present China globally", SISU has won an unparalleled reputation in linguistics, literary studies, translation studies, intercultural studies and international journalism in Chinese academia, playing an active role in China's diplomatic decision-making. Our research excellence has been further recognized for our progress in political science, by developing a focused research field in global and area studies.

Drawing on our strengths in multi-language programs and multi-disciplinary resources, while responding to national and regional strategies, we operate more than 100 research institutes and centers serving as academic think tanks to provide advisory services on language policies, diplomatic strategies and global communication. These academic entities have contributed landmark research and are also dedicated to promoting the development of social sciences in China.

SISU currently edits and publishes 21 highly regarded and rigorously peer-reviewed **academic journals**.

We have made it a strategic priority in our development planning to go global and actively encourage a global vision by providing unique and valuable experience for students and researchers from all over the world to interact across national, cultural and linguistic borders.

We have now established **partnerships** with more than 440 universities and institutions from 62 countries and regions, and have maintained close connection with international organizations, including the United Nations and the European Union. SISU is an academic partner of the United Nations Department for General Assembly and Conference Management (DGACM), the European Commission's Directorate-Generals for Interpretation and Translation (DG SCIC and DGT) and the UK China Humanities Alliance (UKCHA).
